Please Read below:

On command line, type "python main.py --create_random_graph --nodes (some positive integer) --constant (some positive float) --plot --BFS (node you want to start from the amount of nodes you decided on) --output (filename if you wish to save it)"

ex usage - "python main.py --create_random_graph --nodes 50 --constant 1.1 --plot --BFS 12 --output out_graph_file.gml

Note: Sometimes it doesn't work because the node selected for BFS (for the example above, node 12) might not be there, I wasn't able to figure it out in time but it does work sometimes, so keep trying it again with the same inputs please, it'll work eventually. <3
